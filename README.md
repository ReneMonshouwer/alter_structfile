# alter_structfile
To modify a dicom RTSTRUCT file to delete or rename ROIs inside the dicomfile

Use at your own risk and not for clinical appliations (only research)

The code is in Matlab so (preferably) matlab R2018b is needed to use the program.
Earlier Matlab versions are also working, only the "**/*" (nested wildcard) does not work before 2018b

The executable : alter_structfile.exe can be used after installation of the matlab runtime environment on your computer
This is possible without a Matlab licence
